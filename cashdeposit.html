					<h3 class= "titles">Background</h3>
					<p>Mauqa Online is a service company that provides illiterate people with domestic help jobs. These helpers are trained by Mauqa and sent to customer homes to provide services like cooking, cleaning, babysitting and laundry.</p>
					<p>Once done with their jobs, helpers are required to collect money from customers that choose to pay cash instead of paying online. Once helpers have collected a maximum of Rs 2000 they are required to deposit the money to the company through an online payment channel known as "Jazz Cash". If the helpers exceed this limit, they are penalized by the company. However, a lot of the helpers still failed to deposit the collected money back to the company and as a result, the operations team of Mauqa were forced to spend time and effort to regularly remind or penalize these helpers. The main way to penalize the helpers was by setting them on "time-off" which meant no jobs for those helpers until they deposited the money.</p>

						<h3 class = "titles">Audience</h3>
						<p>The people concerned with this issue were the helpers that did not deposit money on time and Mauqa’s operations team that had to deal with them.</p>
					</div>

				</div>


				<div class = "development">
					<h3 class = "titles">Research & Data Collection</h3>
					<p>We conducted interviews with the operations team members to understand the issue from their end. The main problems faced by the operations team were:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Keeping track of helpers that did not submit money on time and reminding them was a fully manual process prone to errors and delays.</li>
						<li>Setting helpers on time-off or letting them go led to low supply issues.</li>
					</ul>

				

					<p>After understanding the issue from the side of the operations team, we conducted focus groups with the helpers to study the problem from their point of view. We uncovered the following issues:</p>

					<ul>
						<li>Jazz cash retailers hard to find</li>
						<li>Need extra cash for personal emergencies</li>
						<li>Low financial literacy: hard to differentiate between company and own money</li>
						<li>No time after full-day jobs to deposit money</li>
					</ul>

				<div class = "development">
					<h3 class = "titles">Ideation</h3>
					<p>With these problems in mind, we conducted a group ideation session to brainstorm solutions for the problems that we had uncovered and proposed the following action plan to solve the cash deposit issue:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>The operations team were advised to increase the cash-in-hand limit to allow helpers to easily deposit money before they reach the limit.</li>
						<li>To improve helper financial literacy, we advised including a thorough module on cash collection and depositing in helper training.</li>
						<li>To prevent helpers from spending customer payments on personal emergencies, we advised the company to start a helper fund to provide helpers with loans in case of an emergency.</li>
						<li>To ensure helpers can easily access Jazz Cash vendors, we advised the operations team to inform helpers about the location of Jazz Cash vendors in their areas during training.</li>
						<li>We also advised the company to start sending automatic robocalls to helpers reminding them to deposit money to reduce the manual effort made by the operations team to remind the helpers.</li>
					</ul>
