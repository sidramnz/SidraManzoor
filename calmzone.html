					<h3 class= "titles">Background</h3>
					<p>With the rapid development of infrastructure in urban communities, natural spaces have become increasingly scarce. According to research, people who live in such urban communities can experience increased stress in their lives due to a lack of exposure to nature. Moreover if these urban residents wish to increase their exposure to nature, they have no choice but to travel long distances away from the city to reach a natural space. CalmZone aims to target this issue of reduced natural spaces in urban communities by providing an accessible way for urban residents to experience nature i.e. in a virtual form.

				<div>
					<h3 class= "titles">Design Prompt</h3>
					<p>How might we make natural spaces more accessible to urban residents?
					</p>
				</div>


				<div>
					<h3 class= "titles">Solution</h3>
					<p>Created as a mobile AR application, CalmZone allows users to create a virtual natural space around themselves directly through their smartphone. 
					
					<ul>
						<li>Smartphones are more readily available to users compared to specialized equipment like VR headsets.</li>
						<li>An AR application prevents cybersickness which can take away from the relaxation experience.</li>
						<li>AR enables the user to transform their environment instead of completely blocking it out. This allows the user to feel at ease in their real environment instead of entering a new space.</li>
					<ul>
					</p>

					<h3 class= "titles">Development & Technical Implementation</h3>
					<p>The development process involved gathering virtual assets and audios in Unity, designing the visual look of the app, implementing AR functionality with plane detection and writing C# scripts to incorporate all the elements together.</p>

						<h3>User Testing</h3>

						<div class = "storyline">

							<p>User testing of the project was conducted to improve the interaction of the users with the app. Through testing I learned that:</p>
								<ul>
							<li>Users were unsure of how and where to place the virtual objects so I added in instructions and an always accessible help button. </li>
							<li>Users did not read the text instructions that were given, so I limited text and focused more on visual elements. </li>
							<li>The generic yellow color of the detected planes did not match with the natural space that the app was creating so I added in a grass texture to the plane to make it fit in with the other elements. </li>
							<li>Users tried to place birds on trees instead of the detected planes because as per users: “It feels natural that birds should go on trees”. So I added in functionality to allow birds to be placed on trees instead of just on the ground. </li>
							</ul>

				<div class = "summary">
					<h3 class= "titles">Significance</h3>
					<p>Over time as urbanization has rapidly increased and more and more trees have been cut down to accommodate development, the negative impact on people’s well-being has also increased. Due to this, there is a rising need for more exposure to nature. People will need ways to experience environments that are becoming scarce. Calm Zone aims to be such a way to help individuals cope with these fast changes in their immediate surroundings and experience the nature that rapidly ceases to exist.</p>
