					<p>This project is a VR puzzle game played through the perspective of the main character's ghost. In the game, the player can move around the house and grab different objects to reveal information about the main character's life. As the player moves through the whole house based on the clues given from the objects, the mystery of the main character's death is unraveled.</p>

						<div class = "storyline">

							<p>The first step in designing an engaging experience was designing an engaging story. Deciding the right amount of information to give the player at each step was a challenge because we had to ensure that the information given did not make the plot entirely obvious but also was not so complex that the player would not be able to move forward. Testing the story helped us figure out the right amount of information to give to the user and as a result, allowed us to keep the player engaged at each step.

						<h3 class = "titles">Technical Development</h3>
						<p>With our storyline in place, we started the development process. We gathered 3D models and audios, set up Oculus and designed our experience in Unity using the SteamVR plugin. In our experience, the user could move around by going through teleportation points throughout the room. Through testing with different users, we figured out the ideal places to set up these points to ensure that they would be in good places for users to not only be able to pick up objects around the room but also have them within their field of view as soon as they teleported. </p>
