					<p>A simple campfire left unattended or a lit cigarette can cause forest fires which lead to disastrous results. Through this project, we hope to convey the life that trees bring into this world and how that is ended due to the carelessness of humans.</p>

						<div class = "storyline">

							<p>In order to depict the life of a tree our story was designed with the tree growing up with flowers and birds as it goes through different seasons. This could not only be used to depict the passage of time but also convey the ecosystem that is built around a single tree. The story was concluded abruptly by a fire that completely destroys the tree and everything ends in black. This is meant to show how quickly a complex ecosystem can be destroyed by a simple fire.

						<h3 class = "titles">Project Development</h3>
						<p>To make the story feel more realistic, a miniature model of a tree was designed and laser cut on wood. This was painted white and set on a black background, ready to be used as a projection screen. The story of the tree was created through combining different videos and then Madmapper was used to map the video onto the tree model.</p>

					<h3>User Testing</h3>
					<p>We gathered 3D models and audios, set up Oculus and designed our experience in Unity using SteamVR. In our experience, the user could move around by going through teleportation points throughout the room. Through testing with different users, we figured out the ideal places to set up these points to ensure that they would be in good places for users to not only be able to pick up objects around the room but also have them within their field of view as soon as they teleported.</p>
