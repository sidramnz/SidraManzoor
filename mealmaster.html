					<h3 class= "titles">Ideation</h3>
					<ul>
					<li>In our research we found that one of the main reasons for people wasting food was that they did not know what to do with leftovers. So to help with this problem we decided to include a recommendations page “Just For You!” that would give the users recipes based on the current ingredients in the users refrigerator.</li>
					<li>It was hard for our target users to keep track of all the items in their fridge. If something was not in sight, it would be forgotten and often expired before use. To prevent this, we created a “My Fridge” page that would help the user keep track of what’s in their fridge through an app without having to continuously check their fridge. Based on food expiration dates, the app would also send the user notifications if an item was about to expire.</li>
					<li>We decided to include a social aspect into the app so that users would be encouraged to continue to prevent wastage. In our app each user could establish a social network, upload their personal recipes and read their friends recipes. Users could also favorite eachother’s recipes to encourage one another to creatively use up the food leftover in their fridge.</li>

						<h3>Prototyping</h3>

						<div class = "storyline">

							<p>Initially, paper was used for design sketches. Afterwards, the finalized paper sketches were used to create a polished version of the app on Axure. Throughout the design process, user testing was conducted in order to understand the strengths and weaknesses of the design which then helped in creating a more effective, user-friendly design.
